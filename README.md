# DiffusionCryptoSuiteTechPro

## Description

A repository containing a novel elliptic curve cryptography library optimized for embedded systems using ARM Neon intrinsics and resistance against side-channel attacks via masked scalar multiplication.

## Features

- Integrates advanced homomorphic encryption schemes for privacy-preserving data analysis.
- Leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enable secure authentication without revealing sensitive information.
- Implements post-quantum cryptography algorithms to mitigate future threats from quantum computers.
- Supports secure multi-party computation protocols for collaborative data processing.
- Employs differential privacy techniques to protect user data while maintaining data utility.
- Utilizes verifiable random functions for decentralized and tamper-proof randomness generation.
- Includes a hardware security module (HSM) integration for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
- Provides a comprehensive API for developers to easily integrate advanced cryptographic functionalities.
